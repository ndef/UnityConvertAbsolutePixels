# UnityConvertAbsolutePixels
Unity editor script for converting between RectTransform positioning modes.

This is an editor script that allows you to quickly convert between absolute (pixel offsets) and relative (proportional anchor values) modes for RectTransform UI elements in Unity 2019. These two functions will appear in the Tools > UI menu when an appropriate RectTransform is selected.

Copy the script into an "Editor" folder in your Unity project and the menu options will appear.
